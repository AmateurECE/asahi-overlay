The asahi-kernel dist-kernel is now available for use in unstable.
It uses the config from the upstream ALARM PKGBUILD, which should cover
virtually all use cases in terms of hardware features. Eventually, we
will need to move to the Fedora config, but there's still work to be
done before that can be viable.

This is the final piece of the puzzle for creating completely vanilla
boot media. Of course, the overlay will still be required for a properly
useable system for quite some time. This merely enables us to offer
LiveCDs bootable on Apple Silicon Macs as well as packaged stage4s for
integration into the Asahi Installer.

If you wish to use the dist-kernel now, please follow these steps:
    1. Mask off virtual/dist-kernel::gentoo
    2. emerge --deselect sys-kernel/asahi-sources
    3. emerge -av asahi-kernel
    4. Regenerate your GRUB config
    5. emerge -c
