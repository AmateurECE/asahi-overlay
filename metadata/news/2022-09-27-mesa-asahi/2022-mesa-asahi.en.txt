We have now added Mesa to the Asahi overlay. This allows us to
enable AGX/Asahi Gallium driver support without waiting for the
ebuild to be changed upstream.


Steps required to build the Asahi Gallium driver:

1. Add VIDEO_CARDS="asahi" to your make.conf.
2. Run
    # emerge -1av media-libs/mesa
   This will source the ebuild from the Asahi overlay and replace the
   version currently installed.

This will allow you to enjoy 3D acceleration as soon as DCP and AGX
are merged into linux-asahi with no further intervention required.
Simply update the kernel when the time comes and reboot.
