Due to some QA checks required for getting the overlay added to
api.g.o, we have had to demote some packages back to ~arm64. This was
necessary to prevent pkgcheck from complaining about unresolvable dependencies.

User Action Required:
    1. Add ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arm64" to your make.conf if you haven't already
    2. emerge -auvDN @world
