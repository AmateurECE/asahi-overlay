The media-libs/asahi-audio package has been slotted in preparation for
WirePlumber 0.5 to be released for ~arm64. As we had to make a breaking change
in asahi-audio to accommodate the API change for WirePlumber 0.5, development
has diverged into two branches. To reflect this in Gentoo, we have SLOTted
the two branches. If you try to update, you will notice a hard blocker between
media-libs/asahi-audio:0 and media-libs/asahi-audio:1.0.

User Action Required:
    1. emerge -C media-libs/asahi-audio:0
    2. emerge -1av media-libs/asahi-audio:1.0

As the installed file trees are identical between the old :0 SLOT and :1.0,
:0 must be manually removed *before* :1.0 can be merged.
