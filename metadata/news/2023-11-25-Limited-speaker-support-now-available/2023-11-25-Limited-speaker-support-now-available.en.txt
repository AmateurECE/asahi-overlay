It's finally here! Speaker support has started rolling out, beginning
with the 13" M1 MacBook Pro. More machines are coming soon.

Enabling/preparing for speaker support is quite simple:
1. Update your @world set, kernel and m1n1.
2. Emerge asahi-audio, which will pull in speakersafetyd
3. Enable speakersafetyd (standard OpenRC/systemd methods apply here)
4. Reboot

This only has to be done once. Any enabling of future machines will be
handled with a simple update of the asahi-audio and speakersafetyd packages.

Both asahi-audio and speakersafetyd are gated behind ~arm64 as they depend
on upstream packages which are also ~arm64.

Note that asahi-audio depends on Pipewire and Wireplumber. If you are
not using Pipewire for audio, emerge speakersafetyd directly instead. Understand that
this setup will result in extremely low sound quality and is entirely unsupported.
You will not be given assistance unless you are using the DSP graphs through
Pipewire/Wireplumber.
