You may notice some rather large changes to some packages and ebuilds
inside this repo. This is in an attempt to improve the integration
of the repo with upstream Portage tools such as equery, and perhaps
even attain "official" status on overlays.g.o.

All reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that packages still
build and install correctly. If, however, something is broken, pleaase
drop by #asahi-alt on OFTC and ping me (@chadmed).
