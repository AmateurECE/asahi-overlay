We have unfortunately had to remove support for krunvm/libkrun. This is due to
the fact that many of the pieces required to make this work for the Asahi use
case are actually hidden in private branches and repos, which are manually
packaged into tarballs for the Fedora build infrastructure to pick up, rather
than the usual paradigm of specifying a public repository of sources in the RPM
spec file.

If you have installed krunvm, please uninstall it by following these steps:

1. $ buildah unshare
2. $ krunvm delete [asahi vm name]
3. $ exit
4. # emerge -c app-containers/krunvm

If you added libkrunfw, libkrun or virglrenderer to @world, remember to deselect
and depclean them too.

Until the branches used for the Fedora COPR are made public, we cannot support
krunvm in Gentoo for the Asahi use case. It is possible that the upstream
versions will land in ::gentoo soon if you are interested in using krunvm
for other things.
