HDMI out is now available on MacBooks with a physical HDMI port 
(14" and 16" MacBook Pros), as well as on the M2 series Mac mini and Mac Studio!

Enabling this support is simple:
1. emerge -auvDN @world
2. Build and install the new kernel as usual
3. Run update-m1n1
4. Reboot

Your APFS stub must have the 13.5 firmware package or newer for HDMI
out to work. If your installation is old, please follow these steps
to upgrade:
1. Reboot into macOS
3. Run the Asahi installer again
4. Do a "UEFI only" installation into the APFS stub corresponding to
   your install, but stop before it asks you to shut down
5. Follow the Asahi installer's instructions to reboot into the second stage
