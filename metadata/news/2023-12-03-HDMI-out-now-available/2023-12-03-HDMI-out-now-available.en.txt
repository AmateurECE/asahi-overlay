HDMI out is now available on MacBooks with a physical HDMI port 
(14" and 16" MacBook Pros), as well as on the M2 series Mac mini and Mac Studio!

Enabling this support is simple:
1. emerge -auvDN @world
2. Build and install the new kernel as usual
3. Run update-m1n1
4. Reboot

Your APFS stub must have the 13.5 firmware package or newer for HDMI
out to work. If your installation is older than August this year, please wait until
the Asahi installer is capable of in-place firmware upgrades. This is being
worked on now.
